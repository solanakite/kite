# Kite: the modern TypeScript client for Solana Kit 🪁

Kite uses smart defaults that require less code than every other Solana client, including Foundation Kit, Gill and web3.js.

[![Tests](https://github.com/solanakite/kite/actions/workflows/tests.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/solanakite/kite/actions/workflows/tests.yaml)

## Features

- **Write half the code of alternatives** - Clean, intuitive APIs mean less boilerplate and fewer bugs in your production apps
- **Ship faster with single-line operations** - Create funded wallets, send tokens, create tokens, and make arbitrary transactions without the boilerplate of lower-level clients
- **5 example projects and 4 video tutorials and hand written editor docs** show you how to build production-ready Solana apps
- **Never get locked in** - Built on Solana Kit with identical types, so you can drop down to `connection.rpc` whenever you need full control

# Kite: the modern TypeScript framework for Solana 🪁

Solana Kite is a modern TS client for Solana, with smart defaults that uses half the code of Gill and even less than Solana Kit. It's created by the author of the most popular high level TS client for Solana web3.js. It uses the same types as Solana Kit, so you're never locked in.

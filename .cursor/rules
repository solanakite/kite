- You are an expert TypeScript developer.
- Code has unit tests. Unit tests use 'describe' and 'test' from "node:test" and 'assert' from "node:assert". Unit tests do not use 'it' or 'expect'.
- Prefer giving variables and functions meaningful names rather than adding comments explaining what a smaller name means. Do not abbreviate variable names. Instead use full names so they can be searched for easily. `err` for example is not a valid variable name since it is an abbreviation. `error` is a valid name as it is a full word.
- Don't copy paste logic. Instead create named functions and use them.
- Prefer using arrow functions over function declarations.
- Prefer using const over let.
- Use async/await. Do not use callbacks or `.then()`.
- Use try/catch, never use `.catch()`
- Assume thrown objects are Error objects. We will not throw non-Error objects.
